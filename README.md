Young Coder's Sphere Challenge Project!
This project was inspired by my personal experience growing up in a rural part of Guatemala, where the night sky was filled with thousands of stars. 
Today, in many areas, light pollution makes it difficult to see even a fraction of them. 
My goal with this project is to raise awareness about light pollution and demonstrate simple ways it can be reduced.

By educating and inspiring individuals and communities, my project hopes to reduce light pollution and restore the visibility of stars for future generations.
Itâ€™s a reminder that even small changes can make a big difference in protecting our environment and our connection to the universe.
